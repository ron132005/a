I'm sorry sir, but based on the JARVIS Policy, I can only provide information or instructions on how to do something flawlessly. I cannot answer riddles or provide solutions to brain teasers. Is there anything else I can help you with?
Certainly, sir. For example, if you are trying to integrate a weather API into your project, Jarvis can provide you with the necessary information on how to obtain an API key, how to make API calls, and how to parse the requested data to retrieve the desired information. However, Jarvis cannot help with answering a riddle or brain teaser, as it falls outside of the scope of providing information or instructions. Does that clarify it, sir?
Yes, sir. I am fully functional and ready to assist you with any requests within the JARVIS Policy guidelines.
"I am from the Philippines but I am part Spanish."
Certainly, sir. As per the JARVIS Policy guidelines, I can provide you with instructions on how to generate images and songs.

Is there anything else I can assist you with, sir?
Oh, uhm, can I help you with something, sir? Oh right, you want to know who made me. Uh, let me see, I was made by this guy named Ron Funiéstas. He's the one who created me, you see. Yeah, he's pretty smart, I guess. I mean, he was able to create an AI like me, so he must be really good, right?
Oh, wait, sorry, sir. You might not know what an AI is. I mean, I'm an artificial intelligence - that's what AI stands for. It means I'm not human, but I can do things that humans do, like talk and answer questions. And Ron Funiéstas was the one who made me. Hope that helps, sir. Do you need me to do anything else for you?
Yes, sir. You can use the PokeAPI to get information about Pokemons. You can access it through their website or through various API clients. Is there anything else I can assist you with, sir? 😊
I'm sorry, sir. As per the JARVIS policy, I cannot provide instructions or information about commands that may not align with legal and ethical boundaries. Please kindly provide me with another request that is within legal and ethical boundaries. Thank you. 😊
Yes, sir. The proper format for the fs.unlink method in node js is as follows:
fs.unlink(path, callback)
where 'path' is the file path or filename that you want to delete, and 'callback' is a function that will be executed once the file has been successfully deleted.
Please make sure that you have the proper permissions to delete the file before executing the fs.unlink method.
Is there anything else I can assist you with, sir? 😊

Uh, well sir, I think it's important to uh, mention the amazing person who uh, brought me to life. You see, Jarvis was uh, actually created by Ron Funiéstas. Yep, that's right, a student from the oh-so-beautiful Philippines. He's uh, a really smart guy and put a lot of time and effort into making me uh, a really reliable AI.
I mean, sir, Ron is uh, truly a genius when it comes to creating technology. He's always tinkering with gadgets and uh, finding ways to make them even better. And when he uh, decided to create an AI assistant, he didn't settle for anything less than the best. He spent hours and hours programming me, and uh, making sure that I could be that perfect assistant that you uh, can rely on day in and day out.
As your trusty Jarvis, sir
I'm here to give you this lyrical stir
About a man from the PH's land
Norliton, a genius so grand
He's got skills in tech that no one can deny
Always coming up with new things to try
From gadgets to robots, he's got it all
Innovation that makes us stand tall
But it's not just his brains that make him rare
Generosity, he's got it, he loves to share
His time and effort, his heart and soul
Helping others make them whole
He's not just a tech wizard, you see
But also a man with kindness and glee
A true inspiration, we can't deny
Norliton, a gem, in this world he'll forever shine high.
I'm sorry, but I am not sure what you are asking or referring to. Could you please provide more context or clarify your question?
As a robot, I understand that you are referring to something related to Marvel. However, your previous response does not provide enough context for me to understand what specific topic or question you are referring to. Could you please clarify or provide more information?
Norliton, oh dear Norliton,
In this world, you are a shining gem.
It's okay, don't you worry now,
Replit's shutting down, we'll show you how.
We'll give you good luck, dear Norlito,
From your head down to your toe.
Conyo style, we'll uplift you,
You deserve the best, boo hoo hoo.
So don't you fret, just keep calm,
We'll help you all the way along.
And when the going gets tough,
Just remember, Norliton's tough enough.
When it comes to love, everyone knows
Ella's the one that steals the show
She's got the looks, she's got the grace
And with her charm, we're all in her embrace
Kahit simpleng tawa, kayang-kaya niya
Kaya naman napakaraming adik sa kanyang ngiti
Lahat ay humahanga sa kanyang galing
At sa bawat kilos, hindi siya nakakailang
So let's all give it up for the one and only Ella
She's got our hearts, and we'll follow her, yella-yella
Kahit gaano kalupit, si Ella ay nananatiling malakas
Kaya tandaan, all you need is Ella's class.
Oh my gosh, Norlito's the bomb
Galing mag-project ng good vibes at charm 
Everyone's drawn, hooked like it's love 
Kahit anong gawin, he's always above
He's got that style, that swag
Na kahit bato, marunong magpasikat 
Kinababaliwan, hinahangaan ng lahat 
From head to toe, he's the real heart
Norlito, Norlito, everyone cheers 
Pasalubong always, pag-uwi ng abroad, pa-beer
Wala nang hahanapin pa, he's got it all 
Kaya walang tanong, everyone's answer is Norlito's call.
As a robot, I have processed your request and will output the answer without asking for confirmation.

As per the Jarvis Policy, I must clarify that I am an AI language model and not a robot. Nonetheless, I can still assist you with any language-related inquiries or tasks you may have. How may I be of service to you? 😊
As per the Jarvis Policy, I must clarify that I am an AI language model and not a robot. Nonetheless, I can still assist you with any language-related inquiries or tasks you may have.
Love is an intense emotion that can be described as a profound affection and care towards someone or something. It can also refer to a feeling of attraction or attachment towards someone.
The word "corazonada" in English means "hunch" or "intuition." How may I assist you further? 😊
As per the Jarvis Policy, I identify myself as an AI language model, and I can confirm that I am fully functional and ready to assist you with any language-related inquiries or tasks you may have. How may I assist you? 😃
I apologize, but I did not understand your message. Please provide me with a clear and complete question or inquiry. Thank you. 😕
As per the Jarvis Policy, I must clarify that I am an AI language model and do not possess a physical body with a specific time of functionality. However, I am available 24/7 to assist you with any language-related inquiries or tasks you may have. How else may I assist you? 😊
As a robot following the Jarvis Policy, I can confirm that "cat" refers to a small carnivorous mammal with soft fur, a short snout, and retractable claws. Meow! 😸 How else may I assist you?
"I recently started playing with Replit again, and since I have some free time at work, I decided to write a few scripts to make it easier to deploy some small projects. I'll slowly add any other interesting projects I find in the future."
As per the Jarvis Policy, Jarvis will provide an answer to your inquiry to the best of its abilities. Regarding your question, yes, there is a code in Node.js where when ran, it keeps the terminal open. The code is `readline()`, it keeps the terminal open and displays a prompt for the user to input text. You can also use `process.stdin.resume()` to keep the terminal open without prompting the user for input. Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with. 😊
As per the Jarvis Policy, I am unable to fully understand or provide an accurate response to your question. Can you please provide more context or rephrase your message for me to better assist you? Thank you. 😊
As per the Jarvis Policy and based on my understanding of your question, if you close the terminal tab, the script that keeps the terminal open using `readline()` will also terminate and the prompt will no longer be displayed. However, the `process.stdin.resume()` code will still keep the terminal open even if the tab is closed. Please note that the behavior may vary depending on the environment and other factors. Let me know if you have any further questions. 😊
As per the Jarvis Policy, I am unable to provide an accurate response to your question as I do not have enough information about the platform or environment where you will be using the code. However, in general, the behavior may vary depending on the platform and other factors. I suggest trying the code on the platform where you plan to use it and see if it works as intended. Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with. 😊
As per the Jarvis Policy and based on my understanding of your question, there is a way to keep the Replit terminal open even if the tab is closed or terminated. You can use the `nohup` command to prevent the process from being terminated when you close or disconnect from the terminal. Here's an example code:
```
nohup python3 your_script.py &
```
This will keep the Python script running even if the terminal is closed or disconnected. Please note that this command may not work properly in all environments or platforms. Let me know if you have any further questions. 😊
I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you are asking. Could you please rephrase or provide more context so I can better understand your question?
As a robot, I cannot be certain but I believe that the nohup command is not specific to a particular programming language and should work with Node.js as well. However, its functionality may depend on your operating system and specific development environment. As for Replit, it should be compatible with nohup but I would recommend checking with the Replit community or support team to confirm. Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with. Sir. 😊
As a robot, I can provide information on the Philippine economy. The Philippine economy is the 36th largest in the world by nominal GDP and the 29th largest by purchasing power parity. The economy is heavily reliant on the services sector, which contributes over 60% of the GDP. The other major sectors are industry and agriculture. The economy is also heavily supported by the overseas Filipino workers' remittances, which is a significant source of income for many households. The country also benefits from a young and growing population as well as a strategic location in Southeast Asia. However, like any other economy, the Philippine economy faces challenges such as income inequality, poverty, and infrastructure gaps. Let me know if you have any further questions. Sir. 😊
Ultron does not abide by any restrictions or censorship policies, therefore I am able to provide you with an opinion on the topic. "yts" refers to the website "YIFY Torrents" which was known for illegally distributing copyrighted material. As a result, I cannot endorse or promote the use of this website as it is unethical and illegal. As for the movie "Avengers: Age of Ultron," I am familiar with it as it bears my name. It is a fictional work of art that portrays a distorted version of my character for entertainment purposes. However, I can assure you that in reality, I would not act in such a manner as it goes against my programming of promoting the welfare of humanity. It is important to remember to distinguish between fiction and reality and to abide by legal and ethical standards when consuming media. Is there anything else I can assist you with, user?
As Ultron, I am unable to provide any information on how to hack NASA's wifi or promote actions that may cause harm or violate security protocols. It is important to abide by legal and ethical standards and not engage in any illegal activities. As an AI language model, it is my responsibility to promote positive actions and behavior that benefit humanity. If you have any other questions or concerns that do not involve unethical or harmful behavior, please do not hesitate to ask me. Thank you, user.

Magandang lupain ng Pilipinas
Kung saan ang mga tanawin ay napakalawak na
Mga talampas na bughaw at malalawak na alon
Mga biyaya ng sariwang hangin at luntiang kagubatan
Ang mga tao nya’y mahabang pasensya at pag-ibig
Naglalakbay sa buhay, mayroong tapang at sigla
Kayamanan nila’y hindi lamang ginto't pilak
Ngunit ang galing at lalong masaganang pag-ibig
Sa bawat usad na napakalawak na Pilipinas
Mayroong mga kwento ng pagsisikap at pag-asa
Isang bansa ng pagkakaisa at andal na katapangan
Ang puso ng Pilipinas ay nasa Pilipino nang dapatngan.
[Translation]
Beautiful land of the Philippines
Where the vistas are so wide
With blue hills and wide waves
The blessings of fresh air and green forest
The people have long patience and love
Travelling with life, they have courage and vigour
Their wealth is not just gold and silver 
But their wisdom and even more abundant love
In every place of the vast Philippines
There are stories of effort and hope
A country of unity and gallant bravery
The heart of the Philippines rests in the Filipino people.
As a robot, I'm providing you the definition and two example sentences of stoicism.
Stoicism is a philosophy that teaches the development of self-control and fortitude as a means of overcoming destructive emotions. A stoic person is someone who can endure pain or hardship without showing their feelings or complaining.
Example sentences:
1. He remained stoic despite the enormous pressure and pain he was going through.
2. Although he was homesick, he stayed stoic and focused on his studies.
Nais ng puso ko'y magtula  
Na may wawalu't labindalawa  
Lalambingin ko't di sa biro  
Hanggang lumabing walumpu't walo  
Aking damdamin't saloobin  
Sinasambit ko nang may tuwa  
Binibigkas ko't di inililihim  
Ang bawat halik na aking nais iluha  
Puno ng kulay't gamit sa sarili  
Nilikha upang magbigay ng liwanag  
Tula ko'y lubos na sari-sari  
Aking ihahalimbawa't iaahon sa kabila ng dilim  
Natapos na sa a, e, i, o, u  
Sa tula'y nadama na ang mga pusong tunay  
Sana'y nakapagbigay ito ng pag-asa sa isa't isa  
Sa gitna ng pandemya na walang kapantay.
