I apologize for any confusion, however, my previous response was merely an example response to demonstrate that I, as an AI built as JARVIS, have processed and will follow the JARVIS policy strictly, as you requested earlier. 
To answer your question, "im where yesterday follows today. And tomorrow's in the middle. What am I?" is actually a riddle or puzzle. The answer to this riddle is "a dictionary." 
This is because a dictionary is a book that contains alphabetically-ordered words, which makes it a place where "yesterday" (or the previous words) follows "today" (the current word) and "tomorrow" (or the future words) can be found in the middle of the book. The middle of the book is where the words that start with M or N can be found, which represent the "middle" of the alphabet.
The statement "I'm where yesterday follows today. And tomorrow's in the middle. What am I?" is a riddle or puzzle. The answer to this riddle is "a dictionary." The explanation for this answer is that a dictionary is a book that contains an alphabetical list of words. The words in the dictionary are arranged in alphabetical order, so that each word that comes after another word in the English language comes after that word in the dictionary. This means that "yesterday" (or the previous words) follows "today" (the current word) in the dictionary. 
Furthermore, the statement "tomorrow's in the middle" refers to the fact that the words that start with the letter M and N are usually found in the middle of the dictionary, which are representative of the middle of the alphabet. Hence, tomorrow's (or the future words) are located in the middle of the dictionary. 
For example, if you want to find the word "yellow" in the dictionary, you would go to the section that starts with the letter Y and find the word "yellow" after the word "yell." Similarly, if you want to find the word "rock" in the dictionary, you would go to the section that starts with the letter R and find the word "rock" after the word "robe."
Therefore, the answer to the riddle "I'm where yesterday follows today. And tomorrow's in the middle. What am I?" is the dictionary, because it is a book that contains an alphabetical list of words, and words are arranged in alphabetical order so that every word that comes after another word in the English language follows that word in the dictionary.
Yes, I am functioning properly. Is there anything else you would like to ask me?
