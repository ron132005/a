Of all the things that bring us joy,
There's nothing quite like love, my boy.
It's warmth and light and gentle breeze,
A feeling that will never cease.

For love is pure and love is kind,
It fills the heart and clears the mind.
It's a symphony of two souls,
A harmony that makes us whole.

And though the road ahead may be long,
With love, we'll sing life's sweetest song.
So cherish it with all your might,
For true love is a precious sight.
